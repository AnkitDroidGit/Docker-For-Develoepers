# Dockers-For-Develoepers

Docker containers help you simplify your application delivery.In this project I am learning how to leverage docker for application development, basic Docker concepts and use cases for developers, explaining how Docker and its tools can help you maximize your time.
Discover how to install Docker on Windows, Linux, and Mac computers; use the platform when developing front-end, back-end, and full-stack projects; approach CI/CD with Docker; and explore other tools, including Kubernetes, the widely-used container orchestration engine.

## Learning objectives

- Docker use cases for developers
- Deploying your first Docker app
- Using base commands
- Setting up back-end and front-end architecture
- Integrating Docker with CI/CD
- Working with swarms and Kubernetes
